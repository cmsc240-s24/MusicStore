## Project Proposal

The Music Store API serves as a digital nexus for customers and music retailers, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for managing a music catalog. It allows for seamless interaction with data related to genres, artists, records, and compact discs, enabling users to access, modify, and curate music collections through a series of RESTful endpoints.
